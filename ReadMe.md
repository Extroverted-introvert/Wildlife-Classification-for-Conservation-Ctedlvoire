This project, developed as part of the WorldQuant University AI Lab on Deep Learning for Computer Vision, focuses on applying deep learning techniques to classify wildlife from camera trap images. The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately identify different animal species (or their absence) to aid conservation efforts in C√¥te d'Ivoire.

The project progresses from foundational data exploration and building a simple binary classifier to developing a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for a multiclass classification challenge, culminating in a submission for the DrivenData competition.

### üìä Key Results
The final Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model achieved a validation accuracy of approximately 84% on the multiclass classification task. The model demonstrates a strong ability to distinguish between eight different classes, including seven animal species and empty "blank" images.

### ‚ú® Key Features & Learning Highlights
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Analyzed class distributions, handled images with different sizes and color modes (grayscale vs. RGB), and implemented data normalization to improve model performance.
Binary Classification Baseline: Built and trained a shallow, fully-connected neural network to establish a baseline for a simplified binary task (identifying a "hog" vs. a "blank" image).
Multiclass Classification with CNNs: Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch, leveraging Conv2d, MaxPool2d, and Dropout layers to effectively handle the complexity of image data.
End-to-End PyTorch Workflow: Mastered the complete PyTorch pipeline, including creating custom Transforms, using ImageFolder and DataLoader for efficient data handling, defining a training loop, and evaluating model performance.
Competition Submission: Processed a test dataset, generated class predictions (confidences), and formatted the output into a CSV file according to competition specifications.

### üìÇ File Structure
The project is organized into a series of Jupyter notebooks that document the step-by-step process.
